[[overview]]
== Overview

Spring GraphQL provides support for Spring applications built on
https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java]. It is a joint collaboration between both
teams. Our shared philosophy is to be less opinionated and more focused on
comprehensive and wide-ranging support.

Spring GraphQL is the successor of the
https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java-spring[GraphQL Java Spring] project from
the GraphQL Java team. It aims to be the foundation for all Spring, GraphQL applications.

The project is in a milestone phase towards a 1.0 release, currently, and looking for
feedback. Please, use our
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-graphql/issues[issue tracker] to report a
problem, discuss a design issue, or request a feature.

To get started, please see the <<boot-graphql>> and the <<samples>> sections.



[[web-transports]]
== Web Transports

Spring GraphQL supports GraphQL requests over HTTP and over WebSocket.



[[web-http]]
=== HTTP

`GraphQlHttpHandler` handles GraphQL over HTTP requests and delegates to the
<<web-interception>> chain for request execution. There are two variants, one for
Spring MVC and one for Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have
equivalent functionality, but rely on blocking vs non-blocking I/O respectively for
writing the HTTP response.

Requests must use HTTP POST with GraphQL request details included as JSON in the
request body, as defined in the proposed
https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md[GraphQL over HTTP]
specification. Once the JSON body has been successfully decoded, the HTTP response
status is always 200 (OK), and any errors from GraphQL request execution appear in the
"errors" section of the GraphQL response.

`GraphQlHttpHandler` can be exposed as an HTTP endpoint by declaring a `RouterFunction`
bean and using the `RouterFunctions` from Spring MVC or WebFlux to create the route. The
Boot starter does this, see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details or check
`GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains a Spring MVC
{github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[HTTP sample] application.



[[web-websocket]]
=== WebSocket

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` handles GraphQL over WebSocket requests based on the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md[protocol] defined in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The main reason to use
GraphQL over WebSocket is subscriptions which allow sending a stream of GraphQL
responses, but it can also be used for regular queries with a single response.
The handler delegates every request to the <<web-interception>> chain for further
request execution.

[TIP]
.GraphQL Over WebSocket Protocols
====
There are two such protocols, one in the
https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws[subscriptions-transport-ws]
library and another in the
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws[graphql-ws] library. The former is not active and
succeeded by the latter. Read this
https://the-guild.dev/blog/graphql-over-websockets[blog post] for the history.
====

There are two variants of `GraphQlWebSocketHandler`, one for Spring MVC and one for
Spring WebFlux. Both handle requests asynchronously and have equivalent functionality.
The WebFlux handler also uses non-blocking I/O and back pressure to stream messages,
which works well since in GraphQL Java a subscription response is a Reactive Streams
`Publisher`.

The `graphql-ws` project lists a number of
https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws#recipes[recipes] for client use.

`GraphQlWebSocketHandler` can be exposed as a WebSocket endpoint by declaring a
`SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` bean and using it to map the handler to a URL path. The Boot
starter has options to enable this, see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details or check
`GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or `GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains a WebFlux
{github-main-branch}/samples/webflux-websocket[WebSocket sample] application.



[[web-interception]]
=== Web Interception

<<web-http>> and <<web-websocket>> transport handlers delegate to a common Web
interception chain for request execution. The chain consists of a sequence of
`WebInterceptor` components, followed by a `GraphQlService` that invokes the GraphQL
Java engine.

`WebInterceptor` is as a common contract to use in both Spring MVC and WebFlux
applications. Use it to intercept requests, inspect HTTP request headers, or to register a
transformation of the `graphql.ExecutionInput`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebOutput> intercept(WebInput webInput, WebGraphQlHandler next) {
		webInput.configureExecutionInput((executionInput, builder) -> {
			Map<String, Object> map = ... ;
			return builder.extensions(map).build();
		});
		return next.handle(webInput);
	}
}
----

Use `WebInterceptor` also to intercept responses, add HTTP response headers, or transform
the `graphql.ExecutionResult`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyInterceptor implements WebInterceptor {

	@Override
	public Mono<WebOutput> intercept(WebInput webInput, WebGraphQlHandler next) {
		return next.handle(webInput)
				.map(webOutput -> {
					Object data = webOutput.getData();
					Object updatedData = ... ;
					return webOutput.transform(builder -> builder.data(updatedData));
				});
	}
}
----

`WebGraphQlHandler` provides a builder to initialize the Web interception chain. After
you build the chain, you can use the resulting `WebGraphQlHandler` to initialize the HTTP
or WebSocket transport handlers. The Boot starter configures all this,
see <<boot-graphql-web>> for details, or check `GraphQlWebMvcAutoConfiguration` or
`GraphQlWebFluxAutoConfiguration` for example config.




[[execution]]
== Request Execution

`GraphQlService` is the main Spring GraphQL abstraction to call GraphQL Java to execute
requests. Underlying transports, such as the <<web-transports>>, delegate to `GraphQlService` to
handle requests.

The main implementation, `ExecutionGraphQlService`, is a thin facade around the
invocation of `graphql.GraphQL`. It is configured with a `GraphQlSource` for access to
the `graphql.GraphQL` instance.



[[execution-graphqlsource]]
=== `GraphQLSource`

`GraphQlSource` is a core Spring GraphQL abstraction for access to the
`graphql.GraphQL` instance to use for request execution. It provides a builder API to
initialize GraphQL Java and build a `GraphQlSource`.

The default `GraphQlSource` builder, accessible via `GraphQlSource.builder()`, enables
support for <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>, <<execution-context>>, and
<<execution-exceptions>>.



[[execution-reactive-datafetcher]]
=== Reactive `DataFetcher`

The default `GraphQlSource` builder enables support for a `DataFetcher` to return `Mono`
or `Flux` which adapts those to a `CompletableFuture` where `Flux` values are aggregated
and turned into a List, unless the request is a GraphQL subscription request,
in which case the return value remains a Reactive Streams `Publisher` for streaming
GraphQL responses.

A reactive `DataFetcher` can rely on access to Reactor context propagated from the
transport layer, such as from a WebFlux request handling, see
<<execution-context-webflux, WebFlux Context>>.



[[execution-context]]
=== Context Propagation

Spring GraphQL provides support to transparently propagate context from the <<web-transports>>,
through the GraphQL engine, and to `DataFetcher` and other components it invokes.
This includes both `ThreadLocal` context from the Spring MVC request handling thread and
Reactor `Context` from the WebFlux processing pipeline.


[[execution-context-webmvc]]
==== WebMvc

A `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by GraphQL Java may not always execute on
the same thread as the Spring MVC handler, for example if an asynchronous
<<web-interception, `WebInterceptor`>> or `DataFetcher` switches to a different thread.

Spring GraphQL supports propagating `ThreadLocal` values from the Servlet container
thread to the thread a `DataFetcher` and other components invoked by the GraphQL engine
execute on. To do this, an application needs to create a `ThreadLocalAccessor` to extract
`ThreadLocal` values of interest:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public class RequestAttributesAccessor implements ThreadLocalAccessor {

	private static final String KEY = RequestAttributesAccessor.class.getName();

	@Override
	public void extractValues(Map<String, Object> container) {
		container.put(KEY, RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes());
	}

	@Override
	public void restoreValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		if (values.containsKey(KEY)) {
			RequestContextHolder.setRequestAttributes((RequestAttributes) values.get(KEY));
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void resetValues(Map<String, Object> values) {
		RequestContextHolder.resetRequestAttributes();
	}

}
----

A `ThreadLocalAccessor` can be registered in the <<web-interception,WebGraphHandler>>
builder. The Boot starter detects beans of this type and automatically registers them for
Spring MVC application, see <<boot-graphql-web>>.


[[execution-context-webflux]]
==== WebFlux

A <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>> can rely on access to Reactor context that
originates from the WebFlux request handling chain. This includes Reactor context
added by <<web-interception, WebInterceptor>> components.



[[execution-exceptions]]
=== Exception Resolution

GraphQL Java applications can register a `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` to decide how to
represent exceptions from the data layer in the "errors" section of the GraphQL response.

Spring GraphQL has a built-in `DataFetcherExceptionHandler` that is configured for use
by the <<execution-graphqlsource>> builder. It enables applications to register one or
more Spring `DataFetcherExceptionResolver` components that are invoked sequentially
until one resolves the `Exception` to a list of `graphql.GraphQLError` objects.

`DataFetcherExceptionResolver` is an asynchronous contract. For most implementations, it
would be sufficient to extend `DataFetcherExceptionResolverAdapter` and override
one of its `resolveToSingleError` or `resolveToMultipleErrors` methods that
resolve exceptions synchronously.

A `GraphQLError` can be assigned an `graphql.ErrorClassification`. Spring GraphQL
defines an `ErrorType` enum with common, error classification categories:

- `BAD_REQUEST`
- `UNAUTHORIZED`
- `FORBIDDEN`
- `NOT_FOUND`
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`

Applications can use this to classify errors. If an error remains unresolved, by
default it is marked as `INTERNAL_ERROR`.



[[execution-batching]]
=== Batching

Given a `Book` and its `Author`, we can create one `DataFetcher` to load books and another
to load the author for each book. This enables queries to select only the data they need,
but when loading multiple books we end up loading the author for each book individually,
which is known as the N+1 select problem.

To address the issue, GraphQL Java provides a
https://www.graphql-java.com/documentation/v16/batching/[batching feature] that allows
related entities, in this case the authors for all books, to be loaded together instead
of individually. Here is an outline of that mechanism:

 - At request time, an application can register a batch loading function in the
`DataLoaderRegistry` for each request, that can load instances of a given entity such as
`Author` from a set of unique keys.
 - A `DataFetcher` can access the `DataLoader` for the entity and use it to load the
entity by its unique key.
 - The `DataLoader` does not load the entity immediately but rather returns a promise, and
defers until it can use the batch loading function to load all related entities together.
 - The `DataLoader` also maintains a cache of previously loaded entities.

Spring GraphQL provides the `BatchLoaderRegistry` to store registrations of batch
loading functions. This is given to the `ExecutionGraphQlService` that in turn uses
it to make registrations in the `DataLoaderRegistry` for each request.

A `DataFetcher` can then look up a registered `DataLoader` and use it to load entity
instances, and likewise a controller method can declare a
<<controllers-data-loader,DataLoader argument>> to access the registered loader for the
entity.

The Spring Boot starter declares a
<<boot-graphql-batch-loader-registry,BatchLoaderRegistry bean>>, so that applications can
simply autowire the registry into their controllers in order to register batch loading
functions for entities.





[[data]]
== Data Integration

[[data-querydsl]]
=== Querydsl

Spring GraphQL supports use of http://www.querydsl.com/[Querydsl] to fetch data through
the Spring Data
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#core.extensions[Querydsl extension].
Querydsl provides a flexible yet typesafe approach to express query predicates by
generating a meta-model using annotation processors.

For example, declare a repository as `QuerydslPredicateExecutor`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
public interface AccountRepository extends Repository<Account, Long>,
			QuerydslPredicateExecutor<Account> {
}
----

Then use it to create a `DataFetcher`:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// For single result queries
	DataFetcher<Account> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).single();

	// For multi-result queries
	DataFetcher<Iterable<Account>> dataFetcher =
			QuerydslDataFetcher.builder(repository).many();
----

The `DataFetcher` builds a Querydsl `Predicate` from GraphQL request parameters, and
uses it to fetch data. Spring Data supports `QuerydslPredicateExecutor` for JPA,
MongoDB, and LDAP.

If the repository is `ReactiveQuerydslPredicateExecutor`, the builder returns
`DataFetcher<Mono<Account>>` or `DataFetcher<Flux<Account>>`. Spring Data supports this
variant for MongoDB.

The {github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http[webmvc-http] sample in the Spring GraphQL repository
uses Querydsl to fetch `artifactRepositories`.


[[data-querydsl-customizations]]
==== Customizations

The Querydsl integration allows customizing the request parameters binding onto a
`Predicate` by accepting a `QuerydslBinderCustomizer`. Request parameters are bound
by default as "is equal to" for each available property in the request.

`QuerydslDataFetcher` supports
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/reference/html/#projections[interface and DTO projections]
to transform query results before returning these for further GraphQL processing.


[[data-querydsl-registration]]
==== Auto Registration

`QuerydslDataFetcher` exposes a `GraphQLTypeVisitor` that finds top-level queries whose
return type matches the domain type of one or more Querydsl repositories, and registers
a `DataFetcher` for each matching query. This includes both queries that return a single
value and queries that return a list of values.

The repository must be annotated with `@GraphQlRepository`. By default, the name of the
GraphQL type returned by the query must match the simple name of the repository domain
type. Of if they don't match, you can use the `typeName` attribute of
`@GraphQlRepository` to set the GraphQL type name.

Such repositories are auto-detected in the <<boot-repositories-querydsl,Boot starter>>.




[[controllers]]
== Annotated Controllers

Spring GraphQL provides an annotation-based programming model where `@Controller`
components use annotations to declare handler methods with flexible method signatures to
fetch the data for specific GraphQL fields. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class GreetingController {

			@QueryMapping // <1>
			public String hello() { // <2>
				return "Hello, world!";
			}

	}
----
<1> Bind this method to a query, i.e. a field under the Query type.
<2> Determine the query from the method name if not declared on the annotation.

Spring GraphQL uses `RuntimeWiring.Builder` to register the above handler method as a
`graphql.schema.DataFetcher` for the query named "hello".


[[controllers-declaration]]
=== Declaration

You can define `@Controller` beans as standard Spring bean definitions. The
`@Controller` stereotype allows for auto-detection, aligned with Spring general
support for detecting `@Controller` and `@Component` classes on the classpath and
auto-registering bean definitions for them. It also acts as a stereotype for the annotated
class, indicating its role as a data fetching component in a GraphQL application.

`AnnotatedDataFetcherConfigurer` detects `@Controller` beans and registers their
annotated handler methods as ``DataFetcher``s via `RuntimeWiring.Builder`. It is an
implementation of `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` which can be added to `GraphQlSource.Builder`.
The Spring Boot starter automatically declares `AnnotatedDataFetcherConfigurer` as a bean
and adds all `RuntimeWiringConfigurer` beans to `GraphQlSource.Builder` and that enables
support for annotated ``DataFetcher``s, see <<boot-graphql-runtimewiring>>.


[[controllers-mapping]]
=== Mapping

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation maps a handler method to a field in the GraphQL schema
and declares it to be the `DataFetcher` for that field. The annotation can specify the
parent type name, and the field name:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book", field="author")
		public Author getAuthor(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can also leave out those attributes, in which case the
field name defaults to the method name, while the type name defaults to the simple class
name of the source/parent object injected into the method. For example, the below
defaults to type "Book" and field "author":

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `@SchemaMapping` annotation can be declared at the class level to specify a default
type name for all handler methods in the class.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@SchemaMapping(typeName="Book")
	public class BookController {

		// @SchemaMapping methods for fields of the "Book" type

	}
----

`@QueryMapping`, `@MutationMapping`, and `@SubscriptionMapping` are meta annotations that
are themselves annotated with `@SchemaMapping` and have the typeName preset to `Query`,
`Mutation`, or `Subscription` respectively. Effectively, these are shortcut annotations
for fields under the Query, Mutation, and Subscription types respectively. For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}

		@SubscriptionMapping
		public Flux<Book> newPublications() {
			// ...
		}
	}
----


[[controllers-methods]]
=== Handler Methods

`@SchemaMapping` handler methods have flexible signatures and can choose from a range of
method arguments and return values..


[[controllers-arguments]]
==== Method Arguments

Annotated handler methods can choose from one of the following method arguments:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Method Argument | Description

| `@Argument`
| For access to field arguments with conversion.
  See <<controllers-argument>>.

| Source
| For access to the source (i.e. parent/container) instance of the field.
  See <<controllers-source>>.

| `DataLoader`
| For access to a `DataLoader` in the `DataLoaderRegistry`.
See <<controllers-data-loader>>.

| `GraphQLContext`
| For access to the context from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`.
See <<controllers-graphql-context>>.

| `DataFetchingEnvironment`
| For direct access to the underlying `DataFetchingEnvironment`.
See <<controllers-environment>>.

|===


[[controllers-return-values]]
==== Return Values

Annotated handler methods can return any value, including Reactor `Mono` and `Flux` as
described in <<execution-reactive-datafetcher>>.



[[controllers-argument]]
==== `@Argument`

In GraphQL Java, the `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to field-specific argument
values. The arguments are available as simple scalar values such as String, or as a `Map`
of values  for more complex input, or a `List` of values.

Use `@Argument` to access an argument for the field that maps to the handler method. You
can declare such a method parameter to be of any type.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@QueryMapping
		public Book bookById(@Argument Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@MutationMapping
		public Book addBook(@Argument BookInput bookInput) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

You can explicitly specify the argument name, for example `@Argument("bookInput")`, or if
it not specified, it defaults to the method parameter name, but this requires the
`-parameters` compiler flag with Java 8+ or debugging information from the compiler.

The "required" character of an `@Argument` or its default value is controlled at the schema
level.

You can use `@Argument` on a `Map<String, Object>` argument, to obtain all argument
values. The name attribute on `@Argument` must not be set.


[[controllers-source]]
==== Source

In GraphQL Java, the `DataFetchingEnvironment` provides access to the source (i.e.
parent/container) instance of the field. To access this, simply declare a method parameter
of the expected target type.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class BookController {

		@SchemaMapping
		public Author author(Book book) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The source method argument also helps to determine the type name for the mapping.
If the simple name of the Java class matches the GraphQL type, then there is no need to
explicitly specify the type name in the `@SchemaMapping` annotation.


[[controllers-data-loader]]
==== `DataLoader`

When you register a batch loading function for an entity, as explained in
<<execution-batching>>, you can access the `DataLoader` for the entity by declaring a
method argument of type `DataLoader` and use it to load the entity:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
public class BookController {

	public BookController(BatchLoaderRegistry registry) {
		registry.forTypePair(Long.class, Author.class).registerBatchLoader((authorIds, env) -> {
			// load authors
		});
	}

	@SchemaMapping
	public CompletableFuture<Author> author(Book book, DataLoader<Long, Author> loader) {
		return loader.load(book.getAuthorId());
	}

}
----

By default, `BatchLoaderRegistry` uses the full class name of the value type (e.g. the
class name for `Author`) for the key of the registration, and therefore simply declaring
the `DataLoader` method argument with generic types provides enough information
to locate it in the `DataLoaderRegistry`. As a fallback, the `DataLoader` method argument
resolver will also try the method argument name as the key but typically that should not
be necessary.



[[controllers-graphql-context]]
==== `GraphQLContext`

To access the `GraphQLContext` from the `DataFetchingEnvironment`, declare a method
parameter of the same type.


[[controllers-environment]]
==== `DataFetchingEnvironment`

To access the `DataFetchingEnvironment` directly, declare a method parameter of the same
type.



[[security]]
== Security

The path to a <<web-transports, Web>> GraphQL endpoint can be secured with HTTP
URL security to ensure that only authenticated users can access it. This does not,
however, differentiate among different GraphQL requests on such a shared endpoint on
a single URL.

To apply more fine-grained security, add Spring Security annotations such as
`@PreAuthorize` or `@Secured` to service methods involved in fetching specific parts of
the GraphQL response. This should work due to <<execution-context>> that aims to make
Security, and other context, available at the data fetching level.

The Spring GraphQL repository contains samples for
{github-main-branch}/samples/webmvc-http-security[Spring MVC] and for
{github-main-branch}/samples/webflux-security[WebFlux].
